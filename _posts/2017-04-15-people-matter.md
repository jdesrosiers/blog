Not long ago, I went to an Agile Open conference.  It was a great experience, but I noticed something that seemed odd to me at the time.  It had a really touchy-feely vibe to it.  There were moments where I wouldn’t have been surprised if everyone joined hands and started singing kumbaya.  I’m a very down-to-business kind of guy, so all that emotional stuff made me uncomfortable.  I’d rather be talking about software.

I was reminded of this experience as I was reading Kent Beck’s Extreme Programming Explained this week.  I was expecting a much more technical introduction to things like pair programming and Test Driven Development and their benefits.  Instead, the book seems more focused on human interactions.  There was even a section that discussed becoming attracted to the person you are pairing with.

So, why is there so much focus on feelings in such a technical field?  I think there are two reasons: (1) It really is that important and (2) It’s something our industry is really bad at.

The idea that people are important to effective software development is not a new one.  In 1987 Tom DaMarco and Timothy Lister called it Peopleware.  Before that, Fred Brooks showed us in the Mythical Man Month (1975) that people aren’t interchangeable cogs on a software project.

Software projects these days usually involve a team of people and all of those people are doing creative knowledge-based work.  We’ve automated away just about all of the tedious bits.  Compilers convert our human readable code into machine executable binary.  Even the majority of our testing is automated.  So, if everyone on the team is doing work that is critical to the project, the team needs to be of one mind.  Until the technology exists to link a team into a hive mind while they work, we have to communicate the old fashion way.  Writing documents is OK, having a conversation is better, but nothing creates a shared understanding better than shared experience like you get from pair or mob programming.  If working together closely is the best way to do collaborative creative work, then understanding the human aspects of how to effectively work together is critical.

Businesses also need to be aware of the human needs of its creative workers.  Creative workers need a certain degree of autonomy in order to be creative, not to mention to be fulfilled in their work.  Without the freedom to make creative decisions, people don’t take pride in their work and quality suffers.

I had read parts of the Mythical Man Month in the past, but last year I read the whole thing for the first time.  It blew my mind not only how relevant it still is after 40 years, but also how many of the same mistakes are still commonplace today.  Despite having known better for decades, our industry has been slow to change it’s ways.  Many companies still measure projects in man-months although they call it something else like person-hours.  XP is many things, but of those things is one more voice telling us that people matter.  I think we are seeing positive change in that regard, but there is still a long way to go.
